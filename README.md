# ProxyScraperX
A simple tool for scraping and testing proxy lists. Built for the *PrivatePackets* crew—because who doesn’t love free shit that kinda works?

## How to Use
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Run `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProxyScraperX.git`.
4. Run `python proxyscraper.py`.

## Output
Spits out a list of free proxies. Warning: They’re usually slow, unreliable, or dead. For serious proxy action, check my go-to providers below.

## Recommended Proxy Providers
Free proxies are a gamble. I’ve tested these premium ones for real cybersecurity work:
- [BrightData](https://privatepackets.net/go/brightdata) – Insane pool, great for scraping.
- [IPRoyal](https://privatepackets.net/go/iproyal) – Cheap and solid for VPN/proxy combos.

## Contribute
Fork it, tweak it, PR it—I don’t care. Let’s make this useful.

## Shoutout
