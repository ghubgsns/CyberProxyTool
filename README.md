# ProxyScraperX
A simple tool for scraping and testing proxy lists. Built for the *PrivatePackets* crew—because who doesn’t love free shit that kinda works?

## How to Use
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Run `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProxyScraperX.git`.
4. Run `python proxyscraper.py`.

## Output
Scrapes a list of free proxies and tests if they’re alive. Spoiler: Most are slow, dead, or garbage. For real proxy action, see my recommended providers below.

## Recommended Proxy Providers
Free proxies are a crapshoot. I’ve tested these premium ones for serious cybersecurity work:
- [BrightData](https://privatepackets.club/go/brightdata) – Huge pool, great for scraping.
- [IPRoyal](https://privatepackets.club/go/iproyal) – Affordable and reliable for proxy/VPN needs.

## Changelog
- **v1.2 (Feb 2025)**: Added proxy type detection, file export, and top 3 speed rankings. Free proxies still a shitshow.
- **v1.1**: Proxy testing—DOA checks.
- **v1.0**: Basic scraper.
